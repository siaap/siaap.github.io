            <h2>Tennis Through the Ages</h2>
            <p class="columns"><i>Tennis, with its roots embedded in the cultural tapestry of medieval Europe, has
                    undergone a
                    remarkable evolution across the centuries. The game's early iteration, known as "jeu de paume" or
                    the game of the palm, emerged within the secluded courtyards of French monasteries during the 12th
                    century. Players engaged in spirited matches using their bare hands to volley a ball back and forth
                    over a net. The transition to rackets in the 16th century marked a pivotal moment, refining the
                    game's dynamics and setting the stage for its global ascent.

                    In the 19th century, England played a significant role in formalizing the sport. The establishment
                    of the All England Croquet Club in 1868 and the inaugural Wimbledon Championship in 1877 signaled
                    tennis's official arrival on the international stage. The tournament's grass courts became hallowed
                    grounds for tennis enthusiasts, fostering a tradition that endures to this day.

                    The 20th century witnessed tennis's transformation into a truly global phenomenon. The Grand Slam
                    tournaments—Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open—became the pinnacle of
                    competitive tennis, showcasing the talents of legendary players and capturing the imaginations of
                    fans worldwide. Icons like Bjorn Borg, Martina Navratilova, Rod Laver, and Serena Williams have left
                    an indelible mark on the sport, each contributing to its rich and diverse history.

                    As tennis continues to evolve in the 21st century, it remains a symbol of athleticism,
                    sportsmanship, and international camaraderie. From the grass courts of Wimbledon to the hard courts
                    of the US Open, the history of tennis is a captivating narrative that unfolds with each serve,
                    volley, and match point.</i></p>
